# NOT-GATE
A NOT gate also known as an inverter.
It is the simplest digital logic gate.
It has only one input and one output.
The function of the NOT gate is to invert the input signal, meaning if the input is high (1), the output becomes low (0), and if the input is low (0), the output becomes high (1).
